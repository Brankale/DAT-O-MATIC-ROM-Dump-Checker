# NDS roms CRC check
 Check if your NDS roms are good or bad dumps. In theory it should support also other types of roms but in practise i don't know.
 
 This program makes use of [DAT-o-MATIC](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=download&s=64) lists for CRCs checks.
 
 NOTE: You should always download `.dat` files without excluding games otherwise the program can give you false negatives.
